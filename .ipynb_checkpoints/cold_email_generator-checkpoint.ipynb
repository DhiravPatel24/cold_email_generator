They separated from the Command Module, Columbia, and descended towards the Moon's surface. The module's computer and pilot, guided by Armstrong, landed the Eagle on the Moon's surface in the Sea of Tranquility at 20:17 UTC on July 20.\n",

The Eagle has landed.\" Six hours later, at 21:56 UTC, Armstrong stepped out of the lunar module and became the first human to set foot on the Moon. He famously declared, \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\"\n",
